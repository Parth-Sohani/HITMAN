	      The man. The Enigma. The best finisher. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the boy from Ranchi who became the
		  top man of Indian Cricket. The story is no less than a fairy tale. The perfect rags-to-riches 
		  story of a man who went on to become a household name. With the release of ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold 
		  Story’ there is buzz around Mahi’s life. Will the movie cover all aspects of his life? Or as is 
		  the case with most biopics, the darker side will be neglected? Do we really, actually know who 
		  the real Dhoni is? Over the years, there have been times when Dhoni’s name was taken in hushed
		  tones over controversial issues. From ruining careers to match-fixing, Dhoni has faced some 
		  serious accusations. The release of a biopic is a reminder to explore Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s 
		  somber past. As they say, there’s no smoke without fire.

	     </a> <font>WHY INDIA IS RIGHT ON KASHMIR</font><br>
		 "Is there, in all republics, this inherent and fatal weakness? Must a government, of necessity, 
		  be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?"
         Abraham Lincoln put this question to his fellow Congressmen in a special session held on July 4,
   		 1861 - the year of the advent of the American Civil War - the bloodiest war yet to be fought on 
		 American soil, which had fired up when eleven Southern states decided to secede from the United 
		 States of America.
        As Kashmir unrest began this year, the Indian State has taken actions to contain the violence in 
		 the Valley. Human rights organisations and Pro-Pak voices within India as well as abroad have 
		 heavily chastised the present government for what they call ‘India’s brutality against a 
		 legitimate secessionist movement’

	     </a> <font>ALL OTHER MPs SHOULD LEARN FROM THESE FIVE</font><br>
		  Most of us Indians believe that Indian political scene is a bleak and hopeless one and, thanks 
		  to Bollywood, an image of a corrupt, tobacco-munching, pot-bellied brute is called to mind when
		  we think of our politicians. Yet not all is doom and gloom in Indian politics. Today, having 
		  recently celebrated the 70th anniversary of our Independence, it is imperative for us as 
		  citizens to understand and scrutinize the roles and responsibilities of our Members of 
		  Parliament and the work done by them towards the nation building process. Between the Upper and
		  the Lower Houses, we have more than 800 MPs who participate in the governing machinery. Out of 
		  these, we have listed down 5 MPs who stand apart due to their unique initiatives which aren’t 
		  just making a positive impact on people’s lives but are also engaging them in policy making 
		  process of the country. Let’s have a look at these five MPs and their initiatives.
