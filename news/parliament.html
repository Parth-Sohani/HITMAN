  <div id="content"  >
  Most of us Indians believe that Indian political scene is a bleak and hopeless one and, thanks to Bollywood, an image of a corrupt, tobacco-munching, pot-bellied brute is called to mind when we think of our politicians. Yet not all is doom and gloom in Indian politics. <br>Today, having recently celebrated the 70th anniversary of our Independence, it is imperative for us as citizens to understand and scrutinize the roles and responsibilities of our Members of Parliament and the work done by them towards the nation building process. Between the Upper and the Lower Houses, we have more than 800 MPs who participate in the governing machinery. Out of these, we have listed down 5 MPs who stand apart due to their unique initiatives which aren’t just making a positive impact on people’s lives but are also engaging them in policy making process of the country. Let’s have a look at these five MPs and their initiatives:
<br><br>
1. Baijayant ‘Jay’ Panda- Member of Parliament, Loksabha <br>
Constituency – Kendrapara, Odisha<br>
Party: Biju Janata Dal party (BJD)<br>

In 2013, Jay Panda organised a Policy Workshop which aimed at involving young professionals and senior students who have a substantial opinion on public policy and critical governance related issues of the country. The workshop was first of its kind by any Indian MP directly involve youth and listen to their viewpoints. Undoubtedly, this Policy Workshop received tremendous response and since then office of Panda has organized workshops in several premier institutes of the country, like XIMB (Bhubaneswar), MICA (Ahmedabad), ISB (Mohali), MIT-SOG (Pune), Constitution Club (New Delhi) and at Janaagraha & BPAC (Bangalore).

2. Maheish Girri, Member of Parliament, Loksabha<br>
Constituency – East Delhi<br>
Party: Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP)<br>


This first-time MP’s initiative named Girri Chaupal is a platform for quick grievance redressal of the public. Every week, Girri organizes the Chaupal at one of the areas in his constituency and sits there in public, where he ensures that all the government officers from respective departments are also present. MP listens to the grievances of the general public one by one and instructs the concerned government officer to take necessary action and give a timeline for resolution of the issue. Up till now he has organized more than 40 such chaupals in which thousands of grievances have been resolved. This video explains this promising initiative.
