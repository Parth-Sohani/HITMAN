  <div id="content"  >
  The man. The Enigma. The best finisher. Mahendra Singh Dhoni,<br> the boy from Ranchi who became the top man of Indian Cricket. The story is no less than a fairy tale. The perfect rags-to-riches story of a man who went on to become a household name. With the release of ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’ there is buzz around Mahi’s life. Will the movie cover all aspects of his life? Or as is the case with most biopics, the darker side will be neglected? Do we really, actually know who the real Dhoni is? <br>Over the years, there have been times when Dhoni’s name was taken in hushed tones over controversial issues. From ruining careers to match-fixing, Dhoni has faced some serious accusations. The release of a biopic is a reminder to explore Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s somber past. As they say, there’s no smoke without fire.<br>

The very first controversies were centered on Dhoni’s relations with senior players. ‘Captain Cool’ was involved in some not-so-cool altercations with batsman Gautam Gambhir. Once irreplaceable in all formats, especially tests, Gambhir suddenly became a player who couldn’t find his way into the squad. The ICC Test Player of the Year 2009, Gambhir was disbarred from the team on the grounds of his attitude and purported lack of on-field ethics. <br>His decisions on the pitch were believed to be selfish and not in the interest of the team. But other reports suggest that Dhoni’s captaincy was in the line of fire during the same period, and these were some of the gimmicks played by Dhoni to undermine Gambhir’s credibility in front of the selection panel.<br> His connections not only saved his captaincy, but also ensured that Gautam’s place in the team was taken away. Logically speaking, someone who played the most important innings in the World Cup finals of 2011, scoring 97 off 122 balls, or a knock of 75 off 54 balls in T-20 World Cup 2007 when wickets were falling like ‘bicycles in a stand’, cannot be deemed selfish. Their spat has been clearly seen on numerous occasions, be it during IPL matches, where they did not shake hands or Gambhir’s tweets aimed at Dhoni. It’s quite apparent that the two do not enjoy a very cordial relationship.

Dhoni also took up a rift with another Delhi boy - India’s most explosive batsman, Virender Sehwag. His absence at Sehwag’s farewell ceremony was the snowball effect of a lot of tense events. <br>The foremost was the Captaincy Conundrum. Until 2007, Sehwag was supposed to be the one to take over from Dravid as the Captain of the Indian Cricket team. For better or worse, it was Dhoni who ended up being the captain. This was the beginning of a clash, which was exacerbated by Dhoni dropping Sehwag in World Cup T20 finals, picking up Yusuf Pathan instead, who managed to score only 15 runs off 8 balls. As vice-captain, the Delhi Batsman did go on to express his desire of being the captain. But the nail in his coffin was the controversial rotation policy in the 2012 Tri-Nation CB series, where Dhoni claimed that Gambhir, Sehwag and Sachin were too slow in the field, and hence only two of them could be allowed to play. To this, Sehwag hit back saying that his fielding has been the same since the last 10 years. Sachin eventually retired and Sehwag and Gambhir were later dropped.
