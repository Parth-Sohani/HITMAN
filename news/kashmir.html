  <div id="content"  >
    "Is there, in all republics, this inherent and fatal weakness?<br> Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?"<br>

Abraham Lincoln put this question to his fellow Congressmen in a special session held on July 4, 1861 - the year of the advent of the American Civil War - the bloodiest war yet to be fought on American soil, which had fired up when eleven Southern states decided to secede from the United States of America.<br>

As Kashmir unrest began this year, the Indian State has taken actions to contain the violence in the Valley. Human rights organisations and Pro-Pak voices within India as well as abroad have heavily chastised the present government for what they call ‘India’s brutality against a legitimate secessionist movement’. This article attempts to break  the issue down and analyse it in three broad perspectives:<br>

 1.  LEGAL:<br>

In his letter dated October 26, 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu & Kashmir requested aid from the Governor General of India as Pakistani ‘Afridis, soldiers in plainclothes, and desperadoes’ had infiltrated into Kashmir, and were marching towards Srinagar, looting, pillaging, and raping women on their way. India responded promptly, asking the Maharaja to sign the Kashmir Instrument of Accession, thereby legally making Kashmir an integral part of India, under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935.<br>

However, both Jawaharlal Nehru in his telegram to Liaqat Ali Khan, and Mountbatten in his correspondence with Maharaja Hari Singh, made it amply clear that India did not wish to impose its will on the people of Kashmir, and that a referendum would be held in Kashmir once Pakistani aggression from the region had been withdrawn.<br> The same was promised by Nehru in his letter to the then British Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, even though such a promise was not legally binding for the accession to take effect*. TheUnited Nations Resolution on Kashmir, 1948 further made instructions to the same effect, i.e. a plebiscite in Kashmir should be held once Pakistani military had evacuated the state.<br> However, Pakistan never effected a withdrawal. Legally, therefore, India cannot be held liable for not holding a referendum as Pakistan never fulfilled the preconditions for it.<br>

The situation was further exacerbated by the expulsion of about 60,000 Kashmiri Pandit families from the Valley in 1990, which permanently disrupted the demographics of the state. Any plebiscite since would naturally have been an unjust one.<br>

India’s real intent on holding a direct vote can be gauged by studying the case of another mountainous monarchy - Sikkim, wherein the kingdom wasn’t integrated into India until 1975, when finally a referendum resulted in 97.5 per cent voting in favour of a merger with India. It should be noted that in Hyderabad, India engaged militarily only after atrocities were afflicted on Hindu subjects at the hands of Kasim Rizvi's Razakdars^.
