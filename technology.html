	      <font>How Far Are We From the Technology Depicted in Westworld?</font><br>
	      There was a time when the concept of Artificial Intelligence seemed like a whimsical, farfetched idea. That computers would one day be as smart as humans, and maybe more was something that seemed incomprehensible. The concept has been played with a lot in literature and art for many decades. From Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics to the sentient computer Hal 9000, from 2001: A Space Odyssey, fiction helped us imagine artificial intelligence. Today though, it's not fiction anymore, but rather a reality. Computers are learning to see like humans, give cricket commentary, and some are even worrying about an AI uprising.

	   <font>Mobile Money Helped 2% of Households in KENYA Rise Out of Poverty</font><br>
	   Being able to send and receive money by cell phone has helped lift 194,000 households in Kenya out of poverty, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science. Women especially have benefitted from the spread of mobile money, which has helped many move from farming into business, economists say.
